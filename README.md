### Models

A [YOLOv8 pretrained model](https://your-yolov8-model-link.com) was used to detect vehicles.

A licensed plate detector was used to detect license plates. The model was trained with YOLOv8 using [this dataset](https://your-dataset-link.com) and following [this step-by-step tutorial](https://your-tutorial-link.com) on how to train an object detector with YOLOv8 on your custom data.

The trained model is available on my [Patreon](https://your-patreon-link.com).

### Dependencies

The sort module needs to be downloaded from [this repository](https://your-sort-repo-link.com) as mentioned in the video.
