### Models

A [YOLOv8 pretrained model] was used to detect vehicles.

A licensed plate detector was used to detect license plates. The model was trained with YOLOv8 using [this dataset](https://universe.roboflow.com/roboflow-universe-projects/license-plate-recognition-rxg4e/dataset/4) and following [this step-by-step tutorial](https://your-tutorial-link.com) on how to train an object detector with YOLOv8 on your custom data.
